## Rockdot framework for StageXL

Port of [Rockdot Actionscript Framework](https://github.com/blockforest/rockdot) to StageXL/Dart.

### Rockdot brings together the goodness of 
* [StageXL Spring](https://github.com/blockforest/stagexl-spring) IoC container (ObjectFactory, ObjectFactory and Object Postprocessing, Interface Injection)
* [StageXL Commons](https://github.com/blockforest/stagexl-commons) Async library (FrontController and Commands/Operations, also sequences)
* [StageXL Commons](https://github.com/blockforest/stagexl-commons) EventBus (with some tweaks to Operations to make them as effective as Signals)
* [StageXL Commons](https://github.com/blockforest/stagexl-commons) Logging
* [StageXL](https://github.com/bp74/StageXL) - Flash API for Dart

### Rockdot features
* Plugin system making use of all of the above
* Mature UI lifecycle management
* Asset load management (porting in progress)
* Generic User Generated Content backend communication (porting in progress. reading does work.)
* i18n
* Focus on highly interactive rich media applications
* LOTS of examples (porting in progress, coming soon)

Rockdot Dart is based on [Rockdot Actionscript Framework](https://github.com/blockforest/rockdot), which has been in continuous development for several years,
and was used in dozens of highly interactive rich media projects (marketing) for clients such as Mercedes-Benz, Nike, and Nikon, serving millions of users.
