## Rockdot framework for StageXL

Rockdot Dart is based on [Rockdot Actionscript Framework](https://github.com/blockforest/rockdot), which has been in continuous development for several years,
and was used in dozens of highly interactive rich media projects (marketing) for clients such as Mercedes-Benz, Nike, and Nikon, serving millions of users.
